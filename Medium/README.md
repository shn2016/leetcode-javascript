# Leetcode - Javascript - Medium

This folder includes the mid level problems of Leetcode, using native Javascript language, and I have now finished 9 of them (about 500), while some problems are not supported in Javascript.

## Process
* My plan is to solve medium problems at least 3 everyday, and no more than 30 mins for each.
* `11 March 2019`: Started doing medium difficulty as finished 100 easy problemsm, the first two seems not hard.

## Thinking
* I wouldn't consider I can solve medium level easily, but I actually did it.
* `12 March 2019`: The main issue with me is how to optimize the algorithm, I tend to come up with the slowest one first and stuck over there. Gotta break the box.
